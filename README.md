# Apache Camel Masterclass

This code was generated based on the course [Apache Camel with Springboot Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-camel-with-springboot-masterclass).

To execute the code is needed to run `docker compose -f dependencies.yml up` on a terminal, this will create the database, based on PostGresSql, and the ActiveMQ queue.

Hope this could help and enjoy it.

Stack used:
- Spring Boot
- JPA
- Lombok
- Apache Camel
- ActiveMQ
- PostGres
- Docker
